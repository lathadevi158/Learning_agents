## 🚀 How It Works

1. The user interacts with the chatbot through a text input UI.
2. Each message is stored and analyzed for genre-related keywords.
3. Over time, the chatbot "learns" user preferences.
4. If a user asks for a movie recommendation, the chatbot suggests titles aligned with learned preferences.
